1-Define the data model: Determine the structure of the data model including tables, columns, and relationships. This will involve creating tables for departments, roles, and employees with appropriate columns for storing the relevant information such as department names, role titles, employee names, etc.

2-Choose a programming language and framework: Decide on the programming language and framework you want to use to build the command-line application. Consider factors such as ease of use, compatibility with the database system you plan to use, and any specific requirements of your project.

3-Set up the database: Choose a database management system (DBMS) that is compatible with your chosen programming language and framework. Create a database and tables based on the defined data model. Set up the necessary connections and configurations to interact with the database from your application.

4-Implement user input handling: Develop the logic to handle user input from the command-line interface. This may involve using libraries or built-in functions to capture user input and validate it against the expected input formats.

5-Implement CRUD operations: Implement the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the different entities in your data model. This will involve writing code to handle adding departments, roles, employees, and updating employee roles in the database based on user input.

6-Implement views: Develop code to retrieve and display data from the database in the required format for viewing all departments, roles, and employees. This may involve formatting the data into tables or other desired formats for presentation to the user.

7-Implement error handling: Add error handling logic to handle cases where user input is invalid or there are errors in accessing or manipulating the database. This will help ensure that your application is robust and can handle unexpected situations gracefully.

8-Test thoroughly: Test your application thoroughly to make sure it meets the acceptance criteria and functions correctly in different scenarios. Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.

9-Refactor and optimize: Review your code and make any necessary improvements to optimize performance, improve readability, and ensure maintainability.

10-Document: Document your code, including instructions for setting up and running the application, as well as any usage guidelines or other relevant information.
